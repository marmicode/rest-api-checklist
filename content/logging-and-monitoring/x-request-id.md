title: generate a unique X-Request-Id header
---

ðŸš§ work in progress ðŸš§

1. Generate a unique `X-Request-Id` for each request if you don't have an API gateway solution that already does it for you.
2. Log the request id with every message and add it to error responses. This will help for debugging.
