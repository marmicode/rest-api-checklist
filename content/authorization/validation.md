title: validate request data based on schemas
---

ðŸš§ work in progress ðŸš§

If you are lucky to have an OpenAPI specification for your API then you can validate every request using tools like:
- [express-openapi-validate](https://github.com/Hilzu/express-openapi-validate)


or API Gateways like:
- [AWS API Gateway Request Validation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-method-request-validation.html)
